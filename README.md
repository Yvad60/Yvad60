A software developer, a learner, a blogger and a psychologist passionate about web and mobile development, creating software solutions and giving back to the dev community. In my work, I strive for a good job, done and done right, best practices, simple clean code and attention to details. Some of the technologies I enjoy using include TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS and GraphQL but I'm always breaking and trying things out; maybe you should try me tooðŸ¤—.
